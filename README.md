## :speech_balloon: About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Sharing as much as I can of my first NFT project, making it a partially open-source NFT collection in the process. I believe people would appreciate and benifit from such a project, that guides the (first-time) developer or designer from A to Z with simple instructions. The reason? There is so much great information being shared, that you could perhaps get overwhelmed and no longer know which path to take. Did this project help simplify the process for you? Then please [consider supporting me](https://defactofrank.com)

<summary>Additional Information</summary>
<br>

This project is the result of huge research. I'm a long-time GitHub browser, but besides some small projects, never really a power user. I've started writing docs for this project (that are currently in their very early stages so they exist in the private space for now). After I've analyzed many popular NFT projects and other NFT-related docs and videos, I've tried to create a general-propose template that may be useful for any new NFT project. Of course, no template will serve all the projects since your needs may be different.
